DESCRIPTION OF TAKS
The provided Python script automates a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process â€” a core part of any data engineering or machine learning workflow. It ensures data flows smoothly from raw input to clean, ready-to-use output through a structured and reproducible sequence of steps.

The ETL pipeline is built to:
Extract raw data from a CSV file. Transform the data by cleaning, encoding, and scaling it. Load the processed data back into a new CSV file for further analysis or model training. This script is modular and can be easily extended to connect with databases, APIs, or cloud data sources.

These libraries perform essential tasks:
pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical computations, scikit-learn tools for feature scaling and encoding, **os **for checking file paths.
